## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onewilly/William-Oneka-Profolio.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd William-Oneka-Profolio
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

> **Note:** For the Projects section to load locally, you may need to use a local server due to browser security restrictions on fetching local JSON files.  
> You can use Python's built-in server:
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server
> ```
> Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Database Integration

The Projects section is powered by a `data.json` file, which acts as a simple database.  
Projects are fetched and displayed dynamically using JavaScript.  
This demonstrates the ability to work with external data sources and simulate database-driven content.
